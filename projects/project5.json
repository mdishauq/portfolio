  "title": "Absolute-Bare-Metal-Series",
  "description": "This project is a structured bare-metal learning series where I summarize and consolidate everything I learn about microcontrollers. It starts from the absolute fundamentals and gradually progresses to more advanced MCU concepts. All examples and drivers are written using pure register-level programming, without using HAL, CMSIS, or any high-level libraries, in order to achieve a deep understanding of how the hardware actually works.The goal of this project is not only to document my own learning journey, but also to build a solid foundation in embedded systems by implementing each peripheral from scratch and understanding the MCU at the lowest level.",
