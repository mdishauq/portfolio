          <h3>👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Ishauq</h3>
          <p>I am an Embedded Systems Engineer passionate about designing innovative and practical solutions that address real-world problems through technology. I enjoy working with microcontrollers, embedded C programming, electronics, and hardware interfacing to build systems that are not only functional but efficient and reliable.</p>
          <p>My journey in embedded systems has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and a mindset focused on optimization, scalability, and real-time performance. I believe technology should make life smarter, faster, and more meaningful — and I'm driven to contribute to that future.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2>
          <p>I strive to bridge the gap between hardware and software by designing embedded systems that integrate both areas seamlessly. I enjoy working at the component level to understand how circuits operate, while also writing efficient firmware that interacts directly with hardware resources like registers, timers, and peripherals.</p>
          <p>Debugging, testing, and optimizing embedded systems is something I genuinely enjoy, as it challenges both logical thinking and hardware intuition. My long-term goal is to engineer smart embedded solutions that are reliable, safe, and impactful in industries like automation, robotics, and healthcare.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">INTERNET OF THINGS</h2>
          <p>Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in the rapidly growing fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) and firmware development. I work with communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C while experimenting with wireless modules such as ESP32, Bluetooth, and GSM to build connected embedded solutions.</p>
          <p>My interest lies in developing low-power, intelligent devices that can collect data, communicate efficiently, and respond to their environment in real time. Through personal projects and continuous learning, I aim to master embedded communication, RTOS concepts, and edge computing applications.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>Firmware development is where hardware meets software, and I find this intersection incredibly exciting. Writing bare-metal code that directly controls hardware peripherals, optimizing for memory constraints, and ensuring real-time responsiveness are challenges I embrace daily.</p>
          <p>I'm experienced in working with ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, writing device drivers, implementing communication protocols, and developing bootloaders. My goal is to create firmware that is not just functional, but maintainable, efficient, and robust enough for production environments.</p>
